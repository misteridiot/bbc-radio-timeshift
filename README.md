# BBC Radio 4 Timeshift

A project to create a physical radio that plays BBC Radio 4 time-synched to
wherever it is. Uses get_iplayer and omxplayer to download and play the audio
respectively, a set of Python scripts to grab today's schedule and coordinate
download and playback.

Note: a work in progress by a newbie!
